# Install

Download the jar from [releases page](https://github.com/Andradina-Minecraft-Fun/AMFLootchest/releases) and put it into plugins server folder. Load with plugman or restart the server

# Usage

### create loot table

put a chest, and add itens inside. run command `/amdlootchest saveloot loot_table_name` and click on chest. Now you have `loot_table_name` on `config.yml`. You can configure chances now
